The title song of this stupendously successful sitcom brings a smile on my face, every single time. When it 
comes to TV shows, ‘Friends’ is the first word and the last. It is what they call a CLASSIC! This series was 
aired on the US Television and then the world over for 10 long years. What is more fascinating is the fact
 that it had the same star cast of 6 friends all through the 10 seasons.

" What I love about the show is the fact that it doesn’t have a story per se. It portrays the everyday lives 
of 6 friends (Chandler, Phoebe, Joey, Monica, Rachel & Ross) set against the back drop of a coffee shop. Even
in the first episode, there was no narration involved. The show implored the audience to understand the story 
line over a period of time. This might be one of the many things that worked in its favour.

There is something about it which makes it worth watching repeatedly without a pint of boredom. It is about 
friendship, love and family. It touches up on all the emotions without being preachy for even a second. I envy 
the scriptwriters. How abundantly talented people! Same goes for the cast. One cannot resist but fall in love 
with each one of them.

                    The subtlety with which each episode is approached is praise worthy. There is no in the face messages or 
                    mushiness. It leaves a lot of room for the audiences’ imagination .It doesn’t confine the audience’s 
                    thought process neither does it consciously guide them.

            Yes, there is a certain degree of Idealism to it. The Friendships of the real world might not be as perfect or as hassle free. But Life is all about aspiring , isn't it? - for a better companionship, for a happier existence. 'FRIENDS' manifests as a small reason for us to look up to and to aspire.

            The 1990s were a dynamic phase in any part of the world with the advent of many inventions like the internet. Still the show never went out of vogue. I don’t think it ever will.
