"There never has been a sitcom that truly pictures life among the singles (twenty-something) as good as this show does. 
It's not just comedy, it presents the episodes in such a way that one can truly identify with the situations 
they face so the audience has something to talk about in coffee shops too. 
The humor is universal. I feel like I'm part of the group every time I watch it because I feel the different emotions they go through. 
Plus, of course, it is so much fun because it's fast-paced. Every scene and every moment is relative to what is going to happen 
next so you don't feel like it is dragging you onto nothing. Just like how a sitcom should be. Funny!"

"Friends the greatest show of all-time. The greatest show ever, to see the lives of 6 friends develop all at once and 
basically grow up with them was truly great to watch."
